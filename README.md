# BlogAPI
An API that serves as a backend for a blog website or mobile app. Fully Async with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy/SQLite database.

Mostly finished - tweaking as I build a front end

To run in localhost
- clone repository
- preferably create virtual environment
- run pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
- run BlogAPI/main.py
- open 127.0.0.1:8000/docs in a browser
